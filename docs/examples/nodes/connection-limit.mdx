This example shows how to implement a custom handle that can limit the number of
connections it can have. It works in tandem with the existing [`isConnectable`](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/nodes/handle/#isconnectable)
prop so you can always completely disable a handle if you need to. All you need
to do is provide a `maxConnections` prop to the handle. If you leave it out, it'll
assume there's no limit.

To see it in action, try and connect `Node 1` to the middle target node or `Node 2`
to the first target node. You'll see that it doesn't work! Try connecting both
nodes to the bottom target node that has no connection limit, and everything will
behave as normal.

If you're feeling fancy you could extend this example to let `maxConnections`
be a function can calculates that maximum dynamically, but we'll leave that down
to you!
