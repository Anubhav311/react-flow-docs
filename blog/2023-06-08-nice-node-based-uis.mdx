We spend a lot of time thinking (and building) node-based UIs at React Flow. When we see something that sticks out, we try it out, talk about it, and get excited about any features we've never seen before. Here are a small portion of some of our favorite node-based apps from around the internet with surprising UIs, smart interactions, and beautiful visuals.

## 1. Kinopio

</figure>

If you had to build a house, would you use a hammer, or a rainbow [yarn-bombed](https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=yarn%20bombing) hammer forged by a sorcerer? If you picked option #2, try [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club/).

Crafted by the co-creator of [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), it’s an endless canvas of nodes and edges for planning, notetaking, journaling, or whatever your heart desires. There is a lot of attention to detail in how the connectors “hang” between nodes, and how nodes shake when you move them (impatient to be dropped maybe?). I used it to plan an online Christmas party with 2 other folks- it was a perfect place to make something playful.

# 2. Knotend: Lightning-fast Shortcuts

<figure>
  <Image img="/img/blog/2023-nice-uis/ui-knotend.png" alt="" />
</figure>

[Knotend](https://www.knotend.com/) is a keyboard-first flow diagram maker. It’s the perfect combination of speedy and that charming ugly-slick UI with as little styling as possible. The speed of making a flow diagram has never been a bottleneck for me (I usually need time to think between each step), but we love the idea.

If you give it a try, I suggest you take a screenshot of the “Shortcuts” dropdown and see if you can create the flow of your morning routine just with keyboard shortcuts (”Stage to Connect” is an important shortcut).

# 3. Cables

<figure>
  <Image img="/img/blog/2023-nice-uis/ui-cables.png" alt="" />
</figure>

[Cables](https://cables.gl/) is a visual programming tool where the UI has the affordance of a retro video game. The animated edges look great, where you can see your data doing the work of moving down the pipes to get to your final visual output.

# 4. Controller Lab

<figure>
  <Image img="/img/blog/2023-nice-uis/ui-controllerlab.gif" alt="" />
</figure>

[Controller Lab](https://controllerlab.io/) is a tool for mapping inputs and outputs of any device at all. The UI has a retro feel, and we love the drag-and-drop interface with those animated handles. Very cute.

We see a lot of apps that try to put a bunch of controls inside the Nodes, while Controller Lab uses an additional pane on the right side to show what’s going on in each node, which keeps everything looking clean and organized. (This one uses React Flow by the way.)

# 5. Bespoke

<figure>
  <Image img="/img/blog/2023-nice-uis/ui-bespoke.png" alt="" />
</figure>

Bespoke is an [open source](https://github.com/awwbees/BespokeSynth) digital audio workstation. It is by _far_ the most hectic node based UI we’ve ever seen. All of the edges are animated. Each node is blinking. The background is a flashing spectrogram. It looks like a \***\*mess.\*\*** So of course, I had to try it.

Astonishingly, it’s great, and somehow not distracting at all once you get into the middle of creating music. I had a great time playing with it for a couple of hours.

I recommend that you spend 10 minutes of your life to [download Bespoke](https://www.bespokesynth.com/#contact) (it’s free) and follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYBc8X2IxqM) (no music knowledge required). You’ll make noise in minutes, and also get to try some of the _i n c r e d i b l e_ shortcuts that are perfect for a specialized tool (or check out this [cheat-sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awwbees/BespokeSynth/main/bespoke_quick_reference.png)) like these:

- To find the ‘signal generator,’ hold ‘s’ to bring up a menu next to your mouse of all tools that start with ‘s’
- Click and drag a node on top of another node while holding shift to connect those two nodes.

# 6. Ossia Score

<figure>
  <Image img="/img/blog/2023-nice-uis/ui-score.png" alt="" />
</figure>

Ossia Score is an [open source](https://github.com/ossia/score) “sequencer for audio-visual artists, designed to create interactive shows.” If you’re building something complex with a lot of unpredictable use cases, you will want to check out Score to see how they do it.

The tool doesn’t look easy to use at first glance, but it doesn’t need to- this is a tool for experts who might be sitting in this UI for days or weeks at a time. You can switch between a node-view and a timeline-view, which I still don’t quite understand how it works.

In an hour I was able to generate some music, where the volume of the sound would change the color and size of some floating 3d blobs. Nothing worth showing at a local gallery (in Berlin though, who knows!), but it felt good to make something after a few visits to the docs and some video tutorials by the creator.

Mermaid is an [open source](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) JS based diagramming tool that feels like writing Markdown. By writing some pretty simple code, you can create your first diagram in a few minutes with their [live editor](https://mermaid.live/).

I tried using it to build a diagram that would help explain a short process, but I gave up when I realized a no-code tool like [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) would be much faster for that case. I imagine this is best for diagrams with longer shelf-life (like a readme) or for automatically generated diagrams.
